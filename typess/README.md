## Algebraic Data Type (ADT)

now when I say fields, I acually mean parameters.
**value constructors** are actually functions that
ultimately **return a value of a data type**

```haskell
位> :t Circle
Circle :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape
位> :t Rectangle
Rectangle :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape
```

we can pattern match against constructors

```haskell
f (Circle _ _ r) = ...
f (Rectangle x1 y2 x2 y2) = ...
```

to export the value constructor, write `..`;

we could also opt not to export any value constructor by just
writing the type name in the export statement;
that way someone importing our module could only making instances
of our types by using the auxiliary functions (factory functions)

`Data.Map` uses that approach - you can't create a map by doing
`Map.Map ...` because it does not export that value constructor.

You can make a mapping by using one of the auxiliary functions like
`Map.fromList`

Not exporting the value constructor of a data types makes them more
abstract in such a way that we hide their implementation.
Also whoever uses our module can't pattern match against the value
constructors

## Type parameters

type constructors can take types as parameters
to produce new types.

recall templates in C++

```haskell
data Probably a = Noway | Bingo a

位> a = Bingo 'a'
位> :t a
a :: Probably Char
```

the type inference engine figures the concrete type
must be `Maybe [Char]` because if the `a` in
`Bingo a` is a `Char`, then the `a` in `Probably a`
must also be a string

**list as a parameterized type**: it types a parameter to produce a concrete type,

values can have an `[Int]` type, a `[Char]` type, a
`[[String]]` type, but you can't have a value that
just has a type of `[]`

notice that the type of `Nothing` is `Probably a`.
Its type is polymorphic.
if some function requires a `Probably Int` as a
parameter, we can give it a `Nothing` because a `Nothing`
doesn't contain a value anyway and so it doesn't matter
