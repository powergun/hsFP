# Monad Transformer

source: <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Monad_transformers>

haskell cookbook (web version) chapter 18

## Terminology

we will use **precursor monad** to refer to the non-transformer (e.g.
Maybe in MaybeT stack), on which a transformer is based;

**base monad** is the other monad (e.g. IO in MaybeT IO stack)
on which the transformer is applied

Since the `bind operator >>=` and `return` for the transformer
mirror the semantics of the precursor monad, a `do block` of type
`ReaderT Env IO String` will, from the outside, look a lot like a
do block of the Reader monad, except that `IO` actions become
trivial to embed by using lift

In general, there is no magic formula to create a transformer
version of a monad; the form of each transformer depends on what
makes sens in the context of its non-transformer type

## Lifting

`liftM`, applies a function (a -> b) to a value within a monad m,
we can also look at it as a **function of just one argument**

`liftM :: Monad m => (a -> b) -> (m a -> m b)`

liftM converts a plain function into one that acts within m

allows us to apply a plain function to a monadic value

lift function plays an analogous role when working with monad
transformers. It brings (aka promotes) base monad computations
to the combined monad. By doing so, it allows us to easily insert
base monad computations as part of a large computation in the
combined monad.

## Simple Transformer

to implement a StateT from scratch

[SimpleTransformer (haskell cookbook)](src/SimpleTransformer)

## Directory Walker

progressively improve a naive, non-Mt implementation to use Mt

[Directory walker (real world haskell)](src/DirWalker)

## Transformer Stack

the concept of using multiple Mt

[TransformerStack: tooling for the stack](src/TransformerStack)

## MaybeT

develop MaybeT from scratch and see how it dramatically simplifies
real-world use case that relies on early termination - the passphrase problem.

[Transformer from scratch: The Maybe Transformer](src/MaybeTrans)

## FoldStopEarly

source: <https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/monad-transformers>

a fold (left-fold) that does early-termination

following the article, this example explores the use of Either
and State monad; then shows how to use ExceptT to gracefully
handle effect.

recap on `bool`, `either` and `throwError`

## mtl style typeclasses

source: <https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/monad-transformers>

we've established that not only can the `State` monad itself perform
put and get actions, but any transformer layered on top of it can do
so as well.

mtl has a philosophy around generalizing this idea using typeclasses

> (on `IdentityT/Identity`'s runIdentity function) these accessor functions
> are means of extracting the underlying value from the type.
> there is no real difference in meaning between `run` and `get`

P/984

> the important thing is that monad transformers are never sum or product
> types; they are always just a means of wrapping one extra layer of
> (monadic) structure around the type, so there is never a reason they
> couldn't be newtypes

see: src/FirstPrinciples/TypeComposition.hs for a mental exercise

P/986

> (on the Functor instance of `Compose`) now the `f, g` both have to
> be part of the structure that we are lifting over, so they both
> have to be Functors themselves

P/987

> the composition of two datatypes that have a functor instance gives
> rise to a new functor instance.
> you will sometimes see people refer to this as **functors being "closed under composition"**

### Functor, Applicative Instances of Type-Composition

see: <https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_composition> for a reference impl of
the Applicative instance of `Compose f g a` - note the use of `liftA2`;

the goal is to lift `<*>` to `fga` (over the Structure of Compose), and
leave the rest to be handled by the existing Applicative instance machinary -
because fga (i.e. `f and g`) is Applicative;

this is my ghci experiment (I was close to that reference impl):

```haskell
(liftA2 . liftA2 $ (<*>)) [Just [toUpper]] [Just ['c']]
[Just "C"]
```

### Compose Monad instances and issues

P/988

> composing Maybe and List... the result of having done so does not
> give you a Monad
> the issues comes down to a lack of information;
> you are trying to combine two polymorphic binds into a single combined bind
> and this is not possible

### Foldable and Traversable instances of Composed types

foldMap implemention, see: src/FirstPrinciples/TypeComposition.hs

see the reference implementation here: <https://github.com/scarvalhojr/haskellbook/blob/master/chapter25/section25.4-5-6.hs>

**see the similarity to the Functor instance, nested `fmap`**

traversable implemention: see: src/FirstPrinciples/TypeComposition.hs

use the same problem-solving model as in the Foldable case; but note how
the concept of "Structure-Swapping" helps to find the last puzzle piece:

to make sure `Compose` (the old structure) is now inside the new structure
`f`, and to achieve that I have to use `fmap`

## Rediscover Monad Transformers, First Principles P/994

P/994

see a **step by step break down** of the `>>=` implemention for the Monad
instance of IdentityT transformer. This is very helpful! code:
src/FirstPrinciples/IdentityTMonad.hs

> (step 3) f has the following type `a -> Identity m b`
> (step 5) this is different bind.... this bind is its definition
> we know it already has a Monad instance defined for that type, all
> we are doing here is defining how to use that bind in the presence
> of the additional IdentityT structure

P/996

a good recap on `join` - see hsFP/monad/README.md - the **1st fundamental
purpose of monad: a generalized concat**

in the monad stack (in this case the stack is `IdentityT`), if the bind
results in `m (IdentityT m b)` then there is a PROBLEM! because `join`
can not flatten/concat the structures; I MUST find a way to unpack the
inner structure, i.e. `IdentityT m b`; the example here uses `runIdentityT`
as a convenient workaround.

see also P/999

> it doesn't typecheck because `>>=` merges structure of the same type after
> lifting (remember it's `fmap` composed with `join` under the hood)

P/1004

> (explaining the essense of Monad Transformer, v.s. freely composed
> monadic types) this is an example of why we can not just make a Monad
> instance for the Compose type, but we can make a transformer type like
> `IdentityT` where we leverage information specific to the type and
> combine it with any other type that has a Monad instance.
> In general, in order to make the types fit, we will need some way to
> fold and reconstruct the type we have concrete information for.

### Handcrafted MaybeT Transformer

P/1008, see: `src/FirstPrinciples/MaybeTMonad.hs`

> (implement the Applicative instance for MaybeT)
> The idea here is that we have to lift an Applicative "apply" over
> the outer structure f to get the g (a -> b) in to g a -> g b so that
> the Applicative instance for f can be leveraged.

P/1011, **implement the Monad instance for MaybeT**

see how the effect (Nothing causes Nothing, aka short circuit) is threaded
in the impl of `>>=` (the **case-matching** part)

note again that the `return` statement has different meaning due to context-
shift: in the `do` notation, the `return Nothing` part works in the context
of m (Maybe a), the `return` statement honors m, which is has a Monad instance

### Handcrafted EitherT Transformer

P/1012

see: `src/FirstPrinciples/EitherTMonad.hs`

note the impl of `swapEitherT`, that uses `fmap` to empower the base
version `swapEither`; so does the relation between `either` and `eitherT`

### Handcrafted ReaderT Transformer

P/1014

> ReaderT is one of the most commonly used transformers in conventional
> Haskell applications. It is just like Reader, except in the transformer
> variant weâ€™re generating additional structure in the return type of
> the function

note that impl of Monad instance: `ReaderT $ \r -> do`; it can use
do notation because the function `\r -> m a` returns `m a` which is
in a monad context; `a <- rma r` respects this monad context because
`rma r` returns `m a`
