# functors

## Bifunctors

inspired by various sources, particularly hsSysAdmin/thecli (which uses
bifunctor to transform the Exception value inside an Either value)

## Contravariants

inspired by a blogspot; this is still "on the level of useless",
but it can be useful to model pre-conditions

## Derive Functors

this is to show that a newtype that wraps a primative type can become
a functor for free (since this newtype acts like a "container")
